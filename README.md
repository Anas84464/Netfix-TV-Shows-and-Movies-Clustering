and not lose their interest. This is where recommendation systems start to play an important role, providing
valuable suggestions to users is essential.

increase the number of items sold, offer a diverse selection of items, increase user satisfaction, as well as user
loyalty to the company, and they are very helpful in getting a better understanding of what the user wants.

# OBJECTIVE

Netflix Recommender recommends Netflix movies and TV shows based on a user's favorite movie or TV
show. It uses a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model and a K-Means Clustering model to make these
recommendations. These models use information about movies and TV shows such as their plot descriptions
and genres to make suggestions. The motivation behind this project is to develop a deeper understanding of
recommender systems and create a model that can perform Clustering on comparable material by matching
text-based attributes. Specifically, thinking about how Netflix create algorithms to tailor content based on user
interests and behavior.

# CONCLUSION

• There are about 70% movies and 30% TV shows on Netflix.

• The United States has the highest number of content on Netflix by a huge margin followed by India.

• Raul Campos and Jan Sulter collectively have directed the most content on Netflix.

• Anupam Kher has acted in the highest number of films on Netflix.

• Drama is the most popular genre followed by comedy.

• More of the content is released in holiday season - October, November, December  and January.

• NULL HYPOTHESIS -The number of TV shows on Netflix have tripled and number of movies have reduced by 2000 between 2010 and 2018. (REJECTED)

• By using Sillhouette's score and Elbow method , we generated optimal of 20 clusters
for K Means and from Dendogram , 6 clusters were generated.

• In both the cases, one cluster accounts more than 3000 points whereas in other
clusters the points were unevenly distributed. 3.For Tfidf K Means is best for
identification than Hierarchical as the evaluation metrics also indicates the same.
